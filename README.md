# Assignment-01

My website is basically on Band Store where people can buy the merchandise  that band member use when they perform, 
also their latest album too. They can also get the idea about band on about section, so my website contain two sections, 
one is store and another one is about. 

The Store Sections contains:-
-------------------------------
* Album
* Merchandise
* Cart 

All the prices from the first two will be update on cart section and show me the total price, 
and same item cannot add twice or else it will show me an alert message.

There is a purchase button below cart which will enable users to buy their desired products, 
and once they hit a purchase buttton it will show "Thank you" message and everything will get back to its initial state.  

In the about section there is nothing much just the name of band members and a short description of band.
